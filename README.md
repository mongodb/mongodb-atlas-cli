## Installing

### Hombrew on macOS or Linux

```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongocli
```

### Pre-built Binaries
Download the appropriate version for your platform from [mongocli releases](https://github.com/mongodb/mongocli/releases). 
Once downloaded, the binary can be run from anywhere.
You don't need to install it into a global location. 
This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don't have a privileged account.

Ideally, you should install it somewhere in your PATH for easy use. `/usr/local/bin` is the most probable location.

### Build from Source 

#### Prerequisite Tools 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Go (at least Go 1.13)](https://golang.org/dl/)

#### Fetch and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongocli.git
cd mongocli
make install
```

## Usage

Run `mongocli help` for a list of available commands
or check our [online documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/mongocli/master/) for more details

### Getting started

Run `mongocli config` to set up your credentials.

You can also use `MCLI_PUBLIC_API_KEY`, `MCLI_PRIVATE_API_KEY`, and optionally `MCLI_OPS_MANAGER_URL`
to define some of the authentication variables

### ZSH Completion (experimental)
Add the following to your `.zshrc` file
