Upgrades a shared-tier cluster to a Flex or Dedicated (M10+) cluster in the specified project.

The atlas api sub-command is automatically generated from the MongoDB Atlas Admin API and offers full coverage of the Admin API.
Admin API capabilities have their own release lifecycle, which you can check via the provided API endpoint documentation link.

To use this resource, the requesting Service Account or API Key must have the Project Cluster Manager role. Each project supports up to 25 clusters.


This endpoint can also be used to upgrade Flex clusters that were created using the createCluster API or former M2/M5 clusters that have been migrated to Flex clusters, using instanceSizeName to “M2” or “M5” until January 2026. This functionality will be available until January 2026, after which it will only be available for M0 clusters. Please use the upgradeFlexCluster endpoint instead.

This command is autogenerated and corresponds 1:1 with the Atlas API endpoint https://www.mongodb.com/docs/api/doc/atlas-admin-api-v2/operation/operation-upgradegroupclustertenantupgrade.

For more information and examples, see the referenced API documentation linked above.
