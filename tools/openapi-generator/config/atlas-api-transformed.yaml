    The MongoDB Atlas Administration API allows developers to manage all
    components in MongoDB Atlas.


    The Atlas Administration API uses HTTP Digest Authentication to authenticate requests. Provide a programmatic API public key and corresponding private key as the username and password when constructing the HTTP request. For example, to [return database access history](#tag/Access-Tracking/operation/listAccessLogsByClusterName) with [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL), run the following command in the terminal:


    ```

    curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" \
      --digest \
      --header "Accept: application/vnd.atlas.2023-02-01+json" \
      GET "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v2/groups/{groupId}/dbAccessHistory/clusters/{clusterName}?pretty=true"
    ```


    To learn more, see [Get Started with the Atlas Administration API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/configure-api-access/). For support, see [MongoDB Support](https://www.mongodb.com/support/get-started).

  - description: Manages Cloud Backup snapshots, snapshot export buckets, restore
      jobs, and schedules. This resource applies only to clusters that use Cloud
      Backups.
    name: Cloud Backups
  - description: Manages the Cloud Migration Service. Source organizations,
      projects, and MongoDB clusters reside on Cloud Manager or Ops Manager.
      Destination organizations, projects, and MongoDB clusters reside on
      MongoDB Cloud. Source databases can't use any authentication except
      SCRAM-SHA.

  - description: Returns, adds, edits, and removes database deployments. Changes to
      cluster configurations can affect costs. This resource requires your
      Project ID.
    name: Clusters
  - description: Returns and edits custom DNS configurations for MongoDB Cloud
      database deployments on AWS. The resource requires your Project ID. If you
      use the VPC peering on AWS and you use your own DNS servers instead of
      Amazon Route 53, enable custom DNS. Before 31 March 2020, applications
      deployed within AWS using custom DNS services and VPC-peered with MongoDB
      Cloud couldn't connect over private IP addresses. Custom DNS resolved to
      public IP addresses. AWS internal DNS resolved to private IP addresses.
      Applications deployed with custom DNS services in AWS should use Private
      IP for Peering connection strings.
    name: AWS Clusters DNS
  - description: Returns, adds, edits, and removes custom database user privilege
      roles. Use custom roles to specify custom sets of actions that the MongoDB
      Cloud built-in roles can't describe. You define custom roles at the
      project level, for all clusters in the project. This resource supports a
      subset of MongoDB privilege actions. You can create a subset of custom
      role actions. To create a wider list of custom role actions, use the
      MongoDB Cloud user interface. Custom roles must include actions that all
      project's clusters support, and that are compatible with each MongoDB
      version that your project's clusters use. For example, if your project has
      MongoDB 4.2 clusters, you can't create custom roles that use actions
      introduced in MongoDB 4.4.
    name: Custom Database Roles
  - description: Returns, adds, edits, and removes database users.
    name: Database Users
  - description: Returns, adds, edits, and removes Federated Database Instances.
      This resource requires your project ID. Changes to federated database
      instance configurations can affect costs.
    name: Data Federation
  - description: Returns, adds, edits, and removes Atlas Data Lake Pipelines and
      associated runs.
    name: Data Lake Pipelines
  - description: Returns and edits the Encryption at Rest using Customer Key
      Management configuration. MongoDB Cloud encrypts all storage whether or
      not you use your own key management.
    name: Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management
  - description: Returns events. This collection remains under revision and may change.
    name: Events
  - description: Returns, adds, edits, and removes federation-related features such
      as role mappings and connected organization configurations.
    name: Federated Authentication
  - description: >-
      Returns, adds, and removes Global Cluster managed namespaces and custom
      zone mappings. Each collection in a Global Cluster is associated with a
      managed namespace. When you create a managed namespace for a Global
      Cluster, MongoDB Cloud creates an empty collection for that namespace.
      Creating a managed namespace doesn't populate a collection with data.
      Similarly, deleting a managed namespace doesn't delete the associated
      collection.

      MongoDB Cloud shards the empty collection using the required location field and a custom shard key. For example, if your custom shard key is `city`, the compound shard key is `location, city`. Each Global Cluster is also associated with one or more Global Writes Zones. When a user creates a Global Cluster, MongoDB Cloud automatically maps each location code to the closest geographical zone. Custom zone mappings allow administrators to override these automatic mappings. For example, a use case might require mapping a location code to a geographically distant zone. Administrators can manage custom zone mappings with the APIs below and the **Global Cluster Configuration** pane when you create or modify your Global Cluster.
    name: Global Clusters
  - description: Returns invoices.
    name: Invoices
  - description: Returns, edits, verifies, and removes LDAP configurations. An LDAP
      configuration defines settings for MongoDB Cloud to connect to your LDAP
      server over TLS for user authentication and authorization. Your LDAP
      server must be visible to the internet or connected to your MongoDB Cloud
      cluster with VPC Peering. Also, your LDAP server must use TLS. You must
      have the MongoDB Cloud admin user privilege to use these endpoints. Also,
      to configure user authentication and authorization with LDAPS, your
      cluster must run MongoDB 3.6 or higher. Groups for which you have
      configured LDAPS can't create a cluster using a version of MongoDB 3.6 or
      lower.
    name: LDAP Configuration
  - description: Manages Legacy Backup snapshots, restore jobs, schedules and checkpoints.
    name: Legacy Backup
  - description: Returns, edits, and removes maintenance windows. The maintenance
      procedure that MongoDB Cloud performs requires at least one replica set
      election during the maintenance window per replica set. You can defer a
      scheduled maintenance event for a project up to two times. Deferred
      maintenance events occur during your preferred maintenance window exactly
      one week after the previously scheduled date and time.
    name: Maintenance Windows
  - description: Returns, adds, and edits MongoDB Cloud users.
    name: MongoDB Cloud Users
  - description: Returns database deployment monitoring and logging data.
    name: Monitoring and Logs
  - description: >-
      Returns, adds, edits, and removes network peering containers and peering
      connections.

      When you deploy an M10+ dedicated cluster, Atlas creates a VPC for the selected provider and region or regions if no existing VPC or VPC peering connection exists for that provider and region. Atlas assigns the VPC a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block.
    name: Network Peering
  - description: Returns, adds, edits, or removes an online archive.
    name: Online Archive
  - description: Returns, adds, and edits organizational units in MongoDB Cloud.
    name: Organizations
  - description: Returns suggested indexes and slow query data for a database
      deployment. Also enables or disables MongoDB Cloud-managed slow operation
      thresholds. To view field values in a sample query, you must have the
      Project Data Access Read Only role or higher. Otherwise, MongoDB Cloud
      returns redacted data rather than the field values.
    name: Performance Advisor
  - description: Returns, adds, edits, and removes private endpoint services.
    name: Private Endpoint Services
  - description: Returns, adds, edits, and removes access tokens to use the MongoDB
      Cloud API. MongoDB Cloud applies these keys to organizations. These
      resources can return, assign, or revoke use of these keys within a
      specified project.
    name: Programmatic API Keys
  - description: Returns, adds, edits, and removes network access limits to database
      deployments in Atlas. This resource replaces the whitelist resource. Atlas
      removed whitelists in July 2021. Update your applications to use this new
      resource. This resource manages a project's IP Access List and supports
      creating temporary Access List entries that automatically expire within a
      user-configurable 7-day period.
    name: Project IP Access List
  - description: Returns, adds, and edits collections of clusters and users in
      MongoDB Cloud.

      Returns, adds, edits, and removes third-party service integration
      configurations. MongoDB Cloud sends alerts to each third-party service
      that you configure.


      **IMPORTANT**: Each project can only have one configuration per integrationType.
    name: Third-Party Integrations
  - description: Returns, edits, and removes user-managed X.509 configurations. Also
      returns and generates MongoDB Cloud-managed X.509 certificates for
      database users. The following resources help manage database users who
      authenticate using X.509 certificates. You can manage these X.509
      certificates or let MongoDB Cloud do it for you. If MongoDB Cloud manages
      your certificates, it also manages your Certificate Authority and can
      generate certificates for your database users. No additional X.509
      configuration is required. If you manage your certificates, you must
      provide a Certificate Authority and generate certificates for your
      database users.

        Returns all legacy backup restore jobs for one cluster in the specified

        Project Read Only role.

         Effective 23 March 2020, all new clusters can use only Cloud Backups. When you upgrade to 4.2, your backup system upgrades to cloud backup if it is currently set to legacy backup. After this upgrade, all your existing legacy backup snapshots remain available. They expire over time in accordance with your retention policy. Your backup policy resets to the default schedule. If you had a custom backup policy in place with legacy backups, you must re-create it with the procedure outlined in the [Cloud Backup documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/backup/cloud-backup/scheduling/#std-label-cloud-provider-backup-schedule). If you use the `BATCH-ID` query parameter, you can retrieve all restore jobs in the specified batch. When creating a restore job for a sharded cluster, MongoDB Cloud creates a separate job for each shard, plus another for the config server. Each of those jobs are part of a batch. However, a batch can't include a restore job for a replica set.

         After you configure at least one Encryption at Rest using a Customer Key Management provider for the MongoDB Cloud project, Project Owners can enable Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management for each MongoDB Cloud cluster for which they require encryption. The Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management provider doesn't have to match the cluster cloud service provider. MongoDB Cloud doesn't automatically rotate user-managed encryption keys. Defer to your preferred Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management provider's documentation and guidance for best practices on key rotation. MongoDB Cloud automatically creates a 90-day key rotation alert when you configure Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management using your Key Management in an MongoDB Cloud project. MongoDB Cloud encrypts all storage whether or not you use your own key management.

        Creates one MongoDB Cloud user account. A MongoDB Cloud user account
        grants access to only the MongoDB Cloud application. To grant database
        access, create a database user. MongoDB Cloud sends an email to the
        users you specify, inviting them to join the project. Invited users
        don't have access to the project until they accept the invitation.
        Invitations expire after 30 days.

         MongoDB Cloud limits MongoDB Cloud user membership to a maximum of 250 MongoDB Cloud users per team. MongoDB Cloud limits MongoDB Cloud user membership to 500 MongoDB Cloud users per project and 500 MongoDB Cloud users per organization, which includes the combined membership of all projects in the organization. MongoDB Cloud raises an error if an operation exceeds these limits. For example, if you have an organization with five projects, and each project has 100 MongoDB Cloud users, and each MongoDB Cloud user belongs to only one project, you can't add any MongoDB Cloud users to this organization without first removing existing MongoDB Cloud users from the organization.

            deployed to this cloud provider an IP address from this range.
            MongoDB Cloud locks this value if an M10 or greater cluster or a
            network peering connection exists in this project.


            These CIDR blocks must fall within the ranges reserved per RFC 1918. AWS and Azure further limit the block to between the `/24` and  `/21` ranges.


            To modify the CIDR block, the target project cannot have:


            - Any M10 or greater clusters

            - Any other VPC peering connections

             You can also create a new project and create a network peering connection to set the desired MongoDB Cloud network peering container CIDR block for that project. MongoDB Cloud limits the number of MongoDB nodes per network peering connection based on the CIDR block and the region selected for the project.

             **Example:** A project in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) region supporting three availability zones and an MongoDB CIDR network peering container block of limit of `/24` equals 27 three-node replica sets.

MongoDB Cloud locks this value if an M10 or greater cluster or a network peering connection exists in this project.


            These CIDR blocks must fall within the ranges reserved per RFC 1918. GCP further limits the block to a lower bound of the `/18` range.

            if a VPC or VPC connection exists for that provider and region. If
            not, MongoDB Cloud creates them as part of the deployment. It
            assigns the VPC a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block. To
            limit a new VPC peering connection to one Classless Inter-Domain
            Routing (CIDR) block and region, create the connection first. Deploy
            the cluster after the connection starts. GCP Clusters and
            Multi-region clusters require one VPC peering connection for each
            region. MongoDB nodes can use only the peering connection that
            resides in the same region as the nodes to communicate with the
            peered VPC.

            | Status   | Explanation |

            |----------|-------------|

            | NEW      | Someone scheduled a local cluster migration to MongoDB Atlas. |

            | FAILED   | The cluster migration to MongoDB Atlas failed.                |

            | COMPLETE | The cluster migration to MongoDB Atlas succeeded.             |

            | EXPIRED  | MongoDB Atlas prepares to begin the cut over of the migrating cluster when source and target clusters have almost synchronized. If `"readyForCutover" : true`, this synchronization starts a timer of 120 hours. You can extend this timer. If the timer expires, MongoDB Atlas returns this status. |

            | WORKING  | The cluster migration to MongoDB Atlas is performing one of the following tasks:<ul><li>Preparing connections to source and target clusters</li><li>Replicating data from source to target</li><li>Verifying MongoDB Atlas connection settings</li><li>Stopping replication after the cut over</li></ul> |

            **readOnlySpecs** object. Tenant clusters only require
            **electableSpecs. Dedicated** clusters can specify any of these
            specifications, but must have at least one **electableSpecs** object
            within a **replicationSpec**. Every hardware specification must use
            the same **instanceSize**.


            **Example:**


            If you set `"replicationSpecs[n].regionConfigs[m].analyticsSpecs.instanceSize" : "M30"`, set `"replicationSpecs[n].regionConfigs[m].electableSpecs.instanceSize" : `"M30"` if you have electable nodes and `"replicationSpecs[n].regionConfigs[m].readOnlySpecs.instanceSize" : `"M30"` if you have read-only nodes.

            - Set this value to `true` to enable regionalized private endpoints. This allows you to create more than one private endpoint in a cloud provider region. You need to enable this setting to connect to multi-region and global MongoDB Cloud sharded clusters. Enabling regionalized private endpoints introduces the following limitations:
              - Your applications must use the new connection strings for existing multi-region and global sharded clusters. This might cause downtime.
              - Your MongoDB Cloud project can't contain replica sets nor can you create new replica sets in this project.

              - You can't disable this setting if you have:
                - more than one private endpoint in more than one region
                - more than one private endpoint in one region and one private endpoint in one or more regions.

            - Set this value to `false` to disable regionalized private endpoints.
